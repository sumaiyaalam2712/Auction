                                                    simply ask you for a few details – including the
                                                    VIN, some photos, and a brief description of the
                                                    car. You can also choose whether you want to set a
                                                    reserve price, or if you want your vehicle to be
                                                    sold with no reserve. A reserve price is a minimum
                                                    value you’ll accept in order to sell your car – and
                                                    while a reserve auction may seem like an appealing
                                                    choice, we’ve found that vehicles offered with no
                                                    reserve get more bids, more interest, and more
                                                    attention.

                                                    If you choose a reserve auction, we’ll ask you to
                                                    suggest a reserve price – but, based on market
                                                    conditions, we may ask for a lower one before
                                                    accepting your car. Keep in mind that all of our

                                                Immediately after the auction closes we connect the
                                                buyer and seller so they can complete their sale. They
                                                can either use our custom checklist to ensure a smooth
                                                transaction or use our partner, KeySavvy, to handle
                                                everything from payment processing to documentation

                                                    It’s free to <a href="#">submit your car</a>. We
                                                    simply ask you for a few details – including the
                                                    VIN, some photos, and a brief description of the
                                                    car. You can also choose whether you want to set a
                                                    reserve price, or if you want your vehicle to be
                                                    sold with no reserve. A reserve price is a minimum
                                                    value you’ll accept in order to sell your car – and
                                                    while a reserve auction may seem like an appealing
                                                    choice, we’ve found that vehicles offered with no
                                                    reserve get more bids, more interest, and more
                                                    attention.

                                                    If you choose a reserve auction, we’ll ask you to
                                                    suggest a reserve price – but, based on market
                                                    conditions, we may ask for a lower one before
                                                    accepting your car. Keep in mind that all of our
                                                    auctions start from $0, regardless of whether or not
                                                    they have a reserve.
